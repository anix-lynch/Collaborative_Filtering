## 🔍 Project Overview

Collaborative filtering powers many recommendation systems by using similarities in user interactions to suggest relevant items. In this project, we'll develop a user-based collaborative filtering system that finds similar users based on their preferences and recommends movies that like-minded users enjoyed.
